        <span class="bylaws-speaker">
          <span class="bylaws-speaker__title"> All Officers (8) </span>Edit the
          following bylaws and suggest possible alterations. For an edit to be
          added to these bylaws, all members of the club must vote on it; a
          majority of votes is required for the amendment to be ratified.
          However, in extreme situations, when an amendment does not get the
          popular vote, the officers are able to override the voters and publish
          the amendment (an "extreme situation" shall be determined by the club
          advisor). Under no circumstances is an officer (president or other)
          allowed to give a member or non-member an officer position; he or she
          must become an officer through an election (read below). ALL officers
          must have exceptional knowledge in foreign affairs (except Outreach
          Manager) and be able to educate themselves on current events. There
          are no exceptions for this.
        </span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span class="bylaw-elections"  style="text-decoration: underline;">Elections</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        Once every 2 quarters, if there is a vacancy in one of the above officer
        positions, an election will be held to fill that spot. To be a
        candidate, one must have come to 80% of the meetings for 2 consecutive
        quarters prior to the election. The candidate must also be approved by a
        majority of the club staff. This rule it set into motion to prevent
        simply anyone from becoming an officer; coming to 80% of meetings, but
        not demonstrating officer-qualities nor actively participating is an
        example of someone who is not able to run. To be able to vote during
        this election, one must have come to at least 40% of the meetings for 2
        consecutive quarters prior to the election. If you are currently holding
        an Officer position and want to occupy the vacant spot, you are also
        able to run as a candidate; if you lose, you are able to return to your
        previous Officer position, and if you win, you must occupy your new
        Officer position for at least 2 quarters before running for another
        position.
        <br />
        <br />
        Candidates will answer foreign affairs-related questions with the
        school’s buzzer-beater system and give speeches. The winner of the
        “quizbowl” will be awarded 1 vote, and the overall winner will be
        determined by popular vote.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <span class="bylaw-challenges" style="text-decoration: underline;">Challenges</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        Once every 2 quarters (not coinciding with elections), any officer is
        able to be challenged for their position. To be able to challenge an
        officer, one must have come to 90% of the meetings for 2 consecutive
        quarters prior to the challenging and displayed active and appropriate
        participation in those meetings (which will be determined by the club
        staff and advisor). The current officer and the challenger will engage
        in a short trivia contest and will be asked foreign affairs-related
        questions by the president (and other staff members) and will be giving
        speeches as well. The winner of the trivia contestant will be awarded 1
        vote. People who have come to at least 40% of the meetings for 2
        consecutive quarters prior to the challenge are able to vote. Officers
        can only be challenged after they’ve occupied their position for a
        minimum of 1 year, and are able to be challenged a maximum of two times
        by the same person. Any officer is able to challenge another officer,
        and if that officer wins the election, the defendant will be forced to
        vacate their officer position, relinquishing it to the challenger. An
        election will be held to fill the spot of the challenger.
        <br />
        <br />
        The President is only able to be challenged after they’ve been in office
        for 1 year, and the opportunity to challenge the President is available
        once every 2 quarters. Anyone can challenge the President, as long as he
        or she has has attended meetings for 2 consecutive years, and has attended at least 90% of those meetings and have held an officer position for 2 quarters. There will
        be a trivia contest as well, and the other officers will be asking the
        questions. The winner of the “quizbowl” will be awarded 1 vote, and the
        overall winner will be determined by popular vote.
        <br />

        <span class="bylaw-officer-rules" style="text-decoration: underline;">Officer Rules</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        If you are a staff member and fail to come to at least 85% of the
        meetings for 2 consecutive quarters, you will be demoted to the status
        of “member,” and will be forced to vacate your Office position
        immediately; the 25% of absences must be excused.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <span class="bylaw-member-information" style="text-decoration: underline;">Member Information</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        To be a member, one must come to at least 40% of the meetings for 1
        school year, and members are able to write this on his or her college
        transcript. This is commonly known as "club credit”. Do not lie about
        being a member, since the guidance department will confirm your activity
        with the club advisor and secretary. Keep in mind that just coming for a
        few minutes does not qualify as attending the meeting (unless you have
        after school sports/makeup tests); you must stay for at least 15-30
        minutes.
