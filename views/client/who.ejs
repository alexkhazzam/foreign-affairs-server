        We are the Foreign Affairs Club, one of the many well, <i>clubs</i>, at
        <a href="https://www.greatneck.k12.ny.us/nhs" target="_blank" style="color: navy !important; font-weight: bold;">Great Neck North High school</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        <span style="color: navy; font-weight: bold;">Our goal is simple:</span> we strive
            to make everyone aware about important events that are occuring all
            around the globe. To truly be successful in life, one must
            understand the world that they live in&mdash;not just their own
            little microcosm, but places around them as well; how does foreign
            policy work; what influences foreign policy; how does a country's
            economic state influence its decisions; what makes a communist
            country, well, communist? <br />
            <br />
            These are just some of the questions that we seek to answer in the
            Foreign Affairs Club. Through debates, lectures and meaningful
            discussions, we explore a whole new world that leaves us infinitely
            more knowledgeable, yet equally amazed.
